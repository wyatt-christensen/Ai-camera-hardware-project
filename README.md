Color-detection project: AI vision module identified green objects, Arduino code controlled solenoid to launch syringe cap

Overview
This project combines Arduino programming, circuit design, and an AI camera module to demonstrate how computer vision can control physical hardware. The system detects the color green using an onboard AI vision module. When green is detected, the Arduino triggers a solenoid mechanism that pushes a syringe, launching its cap.

Features
* AI camera module detects green objects in real time
* Arduino code processes camera output and controls a solenoid
* Custom circuit design for power and signal interfacing

My Contributions
* Designed and built the circuit hardware
* Wrote Arduino code to recieve input and control the solenoid
* Integrated microcontroller and AI camera Module
* Tested and refined the system for reliable operation
